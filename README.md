# wp_installer.sh
This was a project for school. It also was one of the first scripts, that I wrote, that actually make sense and I can use it in production. This script will download and install packages from the lamp stack (+phpmyadmin). After that it creates the mysql DB and installs and configure  WordPress.

#Requirements

The script is currently written for ubuntu (because this was used for school). So the www root is at /var/www/html.
You also need:
  apt:  installing the lamp stack
  wget: downloading WordPress
